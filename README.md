# Building a Machine Learning Model
This is the companion repository for the Cloud Academy course "Building a Machine Learning Model"

The concepts and code demonstrated in this course were heavily inspired by this [Tensorflow Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/regression).

You can download the Jupyter notebook created in the course from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudacademy/gcp-building-a-ml-model/main/MPG%20Demo.ipynb).

You can download the original raw dataset used for building the model from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudacademy/gcp-building-a-ml-model/main/car-data.csv).
